# Simple-Command-Builder And File Uploader using ssh keys
## I made it for PowerShell and Linux, to use with docker run on Windows and from an environment in Linux

#### For one click using a shortcut to launch this PowerShell script backtest, hyperopt, and download data, to speed up the process of skipping each time copping and pasting or editing the commands into terminal by having either set up default parameters or quickly choosing options that saves copying and pasting, colours for aesthetics :)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### If you have a farm of bots you can automate uploading strategies with updated parameters to designated IP address using SSH with one click
(For Faster uploading without a password use ssh keys)


# !!! Before You Start !!! You need to edit a few lines

## - For Backtest and Hyperopt - where the command will start
###### cd 'C:\Users\...\Freqtrade'
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## - Only Hyperopt - folder with custom IHyperOptLoss
###### $customLoss = Get-CustomHyperoptLoss "C:\Users\...\Freqtrade\user_data\hyperopts"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### You can easily adjust command and default parameters to your needs but mine I found optimal for daily use on my 32 core on 128GB RAM
#### If you don't want it to crash start with two workers and then increase till it crashes, each time you increase --timerange on Hypoeropt the workers might crash so you have to lower (days) or decrease the number of workers (it's all about your ram and finding balance but I would aim for longer days)
#### Same with backtesting will cause memory bottleneck and crash if you don't have enough RAM for --timerange specified

## - File distributer - Add your server's names, file names, IP, user name, password and file destination located on server, then location of files to uplaode (Edit strategy_distribution.json accordingly to File distributer):

###### @{ "name" = "name"; "ip" = "       "; "username" = "          "; "destination_dir" = "/home/.../Servers/Freqtrade/user_data/strategies" },
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
###### $source_dir = "C:\Users\...\Freqtrade\user_data\strategies"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
###### $strategy_distribution_file = "C:\Users\...\Freqtrade\user_data\strategy_distribution.json"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Create a shortcut, for example:
###### C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Users\...\Hyperopt.ps1"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
